# Credit-mode tests for statusline.sh
#
# Once a plan limit is exhausted and usage credits take over, the plan meters
# (burn / all / fable / 5h) stop carrying information — burn in particular
# DECAYS toward 1.0x/green while real money is being spent. These tests pin the
# replacement instrument: cap utilisation, dollars, and a burn that is simply
# two percentages divided —
#
#   burn = (share of the binding limit's cycle still to run)
#          / (share of the spend cap still unspent)
#
# Both terms come straight from the usage payload, so burn is live on the first
# render and holds no state between runs.
