description: Triage D's BareClaude Linear queue, driven by Clara's saved workspace views — Needs Unblocking and Needs Your Sign-off. Classifies the queue FIRST (typically only ~1 in 5 tickets truly needs D), then presents the genuine decisions in one two-tier table — linked tickets + PR/artifact links, the decision needed, and an up-front recommendation — with AskUserQuestion drill-ins on request, and bulk-handles the rest. Use when D wants to clear the Linear decision/approval queue.

## Description

Interactive triage of D's Linear workspace (`bareclaude`), driven by **Clara's saved workspace views**. Surfaces
the queues that gate the fleet, then does the thing that matters most: **classifies the queue before walking it.**
In practice most tickets in the Blocked / In Review states are NOT decisions for D — they are agent-executable work
mis-parked, tickets blocked on other tickets, shelved projects, or completed deliverables awaiting a rubber-stamp.
The skill presents the genuine D-decisions in one **two-tier triage table** (linked tickets + PR/artifact links, the
decision needed, an up-front recommendation, detail blocks below), answers drill-ins via `AskUserQuestion`, and
bulk-handles everything else — while emitting a **suppression report** so the filtering itself stays auditable.

The fleet's agents (Clara/ops, Dara/eng, TARS) create and work these tickets and delegate decisions back to D. This
skill is the mechanism for clearing that decision backlog fast — without losing decision quality, and without letting
the fleet's own labels decide what deserves D's attention.

## Behavior

### 1. Resolve the views (mirror Clara's saved views by filter)

The Linear MCP cannot fetch a saved view object directly, so this skill reproduces each of Clara's views by its
filter. Keep the names identical to the workspace views so they stay conceptually linked:

| Skill view  | Clara's saved view      | Filter (`list_issues`)                                   | Mode                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `unblock`   | **Needs Unblocking**    | `state: Blocked` (OPS + ENG)                             | Interactive decision |
| `signoff`   | **Needs Your Sign-off** | `state: In Review` (OPS + ENG)                           | Interactive decision |
| `deadlines` | **Upcoming Deadlines**  | issues with a `dueDate`, order by dueDate asc            | Risk pass            |
| `ungroomed` | **Ungroomed Backlog**   | `state: Backlog` where description lacks `## Acceptance` | Grooming pass        |

Default (`--view all` off) processes the two **decision** views only: **Needs Unblocking**, then **Needs Your
Sign-off**. Apply `--team` to scope. If the MCP later exposes saved views directly, switch to fetching the view by
name instead of re-deriving the filter.

### 2. Prefetch everything, in parallel

For every queued ticket, fetch description, comments, and relations (`blocks` / `blockedBy`) in one parallel batch.
Speed comes from prefetch — not from bundling decisions.

### 3. Classify BEFORE you walk (the highest-leverage step)

Do NOT assume every Blocked / In-Review ticket is a decision for D — typically only ~1 in 5 is. Using the prefetched
context, sort every ticket into exactly one bucket:

| Bucket                    | Meaning                                                                                              | Disposition                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A — needs D**           | A real decision only D can make (policy, irreversible, security, spend, ambiguous product call)      | One table row + detail block (steps 5-11)                                                |
| **B — bounce to agent**   | Agent-executable work (bug fix, investigation, implementation) mis-parked as if it were a D-decision | Comment "not a D-decision, execute or re-block with a specific non-D blocker" → set Todo |
| **C — blocked upstream**  | Correctly blocked on ANOTHER ticket / external gate, not on D                                        | Leave as-is; note in the suppression report                                              |
| **D1 — bulk-accept**      | Completed deliverable awaiting acknowledgment                                                        | Bulk accept → `Done`                                                                     |
| **D2 — cancel / shelved** | A cancelled / superseded / dead-project ticket                                                       | Bulk cancel → `Canceled`                                                                 |

Keep D1 and D2 as **separate cohorts** — they trigger different irreversible state changes (`Done` vs `Canceled`),
so they must be confirmed and executed separately, never merged into one "handle bucket D" instruction.

Two classification cautions, because this skill filters D's attention using labels the fleet itself wrote:

- **Don't trust the state.** Mislabeling is common, not rare: In-Review tickets with no PR, "ready" comments that are
  days stale, Blocked tickets whose blocker already resolved. Verify (step 8) before trusting a status.
- **Flag cron-generated busywork.** Many tickets are auto-created by a Plan cron to fill "project has zero active
  issues" gaps, then worked into a deliverable and parked for D. Name these in the suppression report — a mattering
  ticket must never be rubber-stamped just because the fleet manufactured it.

### 4. Order by leverage + group keystones

Process **Needs Unblocking** fully before **Needs Your Sign-off**. Within bucket A, sort by: outgoing `blocks` count
(most dependents first) → priority → age. For **Upcoming Deadlines**, sort by soonest dueDate. No transitive
(depth > 1) analysis. **Identify keystones:** where one decision would resolve several queued tickets (shared root
cause, or a policy that answers N tickets at once), group them into ONE table row, not one per dependent (see step
7, 11).

### 5. Render the two-tier triage view (the decision surface) + suppression preview

Render ONE two-tier view per decision view — table first:

- **Tier 1 — compact table.** One row per **decision** (a keystone spanning N tickets = one row), ordered by
  leverage (step 4). Columns: `#` · `Ticket` (linked ID(s)) · `Link` (the artifact D would open to judge — PR,
  vault doc, dashboard, preview URL; `—` if none) · `Decision` (short imperative, e.g. "Merge PR #52") · `Rec`
  (up-front recommendation, e.g. ✅ Merge / ✅ Accept / ⏳ You act / 🚫 Hold). Cells stay short so the table
  survives terminal width — depth lives in tier 2, not the cells. Parked tickets (B/C/D1/D2) appear as collapsed
  rows at the bottom with `—` recs and a parenthetical reason, so the table doubles as the suppression preview.
- **Tier 2 — detail blocks.** Below the table, one `### <n> · <ID> — <verbatim title>` block per decision row:
  2-5 lines carrying the decision substance (context in plain words / latest dated activity / why it matters /
  caveats), then an explicit **Rec:** with a one-line rationale. Recommendations rest on step-8 verified facts or
  are marked **tentative** with an offer to pull the source.

D replies freeform against row numbers ("merge 1 and 4", "skip 3", "more on 2") or drills into a row (step 7).
A freeform table reply is as binding as a dialog answer and routes through the same recording logic (step 10).
D may also pull a parked ticket up into the decision rows, or push one down.

Because D1 and D2 apply **irreversible** state changes (`Done` / `Canceled`), do not execute them off the table
render or a general "proceed" alone. Before any bulk write, show each cohort's **exact ticket IDs, count, and target state**, and get D's
explicit confirmation **per cohort** (accept-these-N → Done; cancel-these-M → Canceled). Then, **immediately before
writing each cohort, run a per-ID preflight**: re-fetch state + context for every ticket (and verified source state
for D2 cancels of code/PR tickets, per step 8), because a ticket can change while confirmation is pending. Drop or
reclassify any ticket that changed since D confirmed, and report the drop — never apply a bulk `Done`/`Canceled` to a
ticket you have not re-validated since the confirmation. Bucket B (→ Todo) and C (unchanged) are reversible and need
no separate confirmation — execute B bounces once D engages with the table (any reply that doesn't countermand
them); C stays untouched either way.

Route each surviving ticket's write through the idempotent record-and-repair logic in step 10, applied per ticket —
a bulk write is N idempotent per-ticket writes, not one opaque atomic operation.

### 6. Just-in-time re-fetch before each record or drill-in

Immediately before recording a decision on a ticket — or presenting a drill-in dialog for it — re-fetch its current
**state AND decision context** — not state alone. The rendered row's recommendation rests on the prefetched
description, comments, relations, and any PR/source facts, and those can change without a state transition (a new
comment, a resolved blocker, a diff update); D may also answer the table minutes or hours after it rendered. Compare
against prefetch (e.g. `updatedAt`, comment count, relations, verified source state from step 8). If the
decision-relevant context changed, refresh the recommendation, re-run classification (step 3) for that ticket, and
re-surface the row to D before recording. If the state changed, a prior `[triage-decision]` marker already exists,
or a keystone already resolved it, **skip it with a note** (idempotency + race safety).

### 7. One row per DECISION; AskUserQuestion only on drill-in

- One table row per **decision**. A decision may span N homogeneous tickets (a keystone that unblocks several; a
  bulk-accept of completed briefs) — one row, recorded on each affected ticket. Keep it per-ticket only when the
  stakes genuinely diverge. **Never merge unrelated decisions into one row or one question.**
- **The table is the default decision surface.** Do NOT open AskUserQuestion dialogs for rows D hasn't engaged.
  A dialog fires only when:
  1. D asks more questions on a row or wants options laid out ("more on 2", "what are my choices here?"),
  2. a drill-in genuinely needs structured options or artifact previews (exact message copy, diff summary, the
     dollar math a choice would enact), or
  3. a D1/D2 cohort needs its per-cohort irreversibility confirm (step 5) and D has not already confirmed the
     exact IDs in chat.
- **When a dialog fires, all decision-relevant context lives INSIDE it**: the AskUserQuestion dialog takes focus
  immediately, so D answers without reading
  prose above it. Prose around the question carries only the clickable links, the post-decision record, and the
  standing interaction affordances below (`skip`/`defer`/`show me the source`, which can't be spent as option
  slots); never park load-bearing recommendation context there.
- **Dialog question text follows D's ask format** (mirrors the framework in
  `infra/references/d-facing-ask-template.md`). Structured and scannable, in exactly this order, each part 1-2 short
  lines — never a run-on paragraph of inlined figures and ticket IDs (that density is the failure mode this format
  replaced):

  ```text
  <ID> — <issue headline, verbatim title>

  Context: <what this ticket is, in plain words — no ticket-diving needed>
  Latest: <the most recent material activity/update, dated>
  Why it matters: <consequence of this decision — what unblocks, costs, or breaks>

  Ask: <exactly ONE clear question>
  ```

  **Example (a real one):**

  ```text
  ENG-1478 — Fix Execute spec: remove phantom .claude/ write-guard

  Context: Execute's task-spec claims a write-guard blocks .claude/ writes in cron runs, so it drafts-and-blocks instead of writing.
  Latest: 7/16 — Dara verified against the live runtime that no guard exists; PR #249 rewrites the spec to attempt-first. CI green, mergeable.
  Why it matters: the phantom caused ~3 weeks of self-blocks and hides 42 of 154 Todo issues from Execute's pickup.

  Ask: Approve merging PR #249?
  ```

- Put the **full linear.app URL** in table cells and prose — use the `url` the MCP returns; never string-build it.
- 2-4 concrete options; tag exactly one **"(Recommended)"** with a one-line rationale in its description.
- Option `preview` panes carry **artifacts only** — the exact message copy, the diff summary, the dollar math a
  choice would enact. Never restate in a preview the context that belongs in the question text; a preview that
  re-narrates the ticket is noise D has to re-read.
- If any option's real substance lives outside Linear (a diff, a vault doc, org state), verify it (step 8) or mark
  the recommendation **tentative** and offer to pull it — never a confident rec built on a source you did not read.
- State once, with the table, that D can type **"skip"**, **"defer"**, or **"show me the source"** against any row
  at any time — do not spend dialog option slots on these.

### 8. Verify against the source system (mandatory at high-stakes gates)

This skill is NOT Linear-only. Linear comments are the fleet's self-report; for anything that matters, check the
source of truth before deciding or recommending. **Mandatory** verification before you record a decision when the
ticket involves any of:

- **Money / payments** — read the actual PR diff; confirm what a change truly touches (e.g. a "disable checkout"
  change may also disable donations if they share an endpoint). Green CI and an agent's own "SAFE TO SHIP" self-review
  are NOT sufficient for payment/customer-facing code.
- **Secrets / identity / access** — query the live system (`gh api`, provider dashboards) rather than trusting a
  ticket's list (e.g. confirm which app is a live identity before a bulk uninstall).
- **Irreversible actions** — deletes, sends, deploys, org-level changes: confirm current real-world state first.
- **Agent self-reported "ready/mergeable/green"** — re-check with `gh pr view` (mergeability + checks); "ready"
  comments go stale within days.

For everything else, source verification is optional but encouraged. When a check contradicts the ticket, treat that
as the finding.

### 9. Escalate to the advisor at the sharp gates

Call the `advisor` tool (set by `advisorModel` in settings.json) **before finalizing** the recommendation when a decision is
**financial, secrets/access-scoped, bulk-destructive, or architecturally constraining** — the gates where a plausible
wrong call is expensive. The advisor runs on Fable and receives this session's full transcript automatically, so the
step-8 verifications reach it only if you actually ran them here — there is no context argument to pass by hand. Its
guidance sharpens the options you present; D still decides. Elsewhere the consult is optional — don't manufacture it
for routine calls.

### 10. Record atomically (re-check, then idempotent write)

On D's answer — for a single A-ticket, or for each ticket surviving the step-5 preflight in a confirmed D1/D2
cohort — **FIRST re-fetch** the ticket's state and scan for an existing `[triage-decision]` marker; D (or the step-5
preflight) may have taken minutes, and an agent may have moved the ticket meanwhile. Resolve the pre-write check by
cases, so a partial write from a prior interrupted attempt is repaired rather than orphaned:

Capture the ticket's **pre-decision state** before the first write attempt, so "partial write" and "drift" are
decided by an actual comparison rather than by a catch-all that swallows both.

- **Marker present AND state already matches this decision** → fully done; skip with a note.
- **Marker present for THIS decision AND current state still equals the captured pre-decision state** (comment
  landed, state write did not, on a prior attempt) → partial write, NOT a conflict: skip the comment op and
  complete only the missing state write.
- **Marker present for a DIFFERENT decision, or current state is neither the pre-decision state nor this
  decision's target** → genuine drift; abort and re-surface the ticket rather than writing stale.
- **No marker AND current state still equals the captured pre-decision state** → proceed with a fresh write.
- **No marker but current state has moved** → drift; abort and re-surface. A missing marker is not permission to
  write: another path may have advanced the ticket without leaving one, and writing here posts a stale comment and
  sets a target D's answer was never about.

The state check is re-run immediately before the state write as well, not only before the comment — the two ops are
not atomic, and the window between them is exactly when another path lands.

Then post the decision comment using the template below, THEN set the ticket state. Make both writes **idempotent**:
before (re)trying either, re-scan for the exact marker/state and treat an existing match as success for that
operation only — never let a completed comment op suppress a still-missing state op. Verify both writes; retry up to
3×. On unrecoverable partial failure, report exactly what landed and **halt** — never advance the queue on an
unverified write. A lost or duplicated decision is worse than a stall.

**Bucket B bounces** get the same record-and-repair contract, keyed on a distinct `[triage-bounce: <ISO-8601
timestamp>]` marker (never bare `[triage-bounce]`, and never `[triage-decision]` — a ticket can be bounced more than
once over its life and bounced now / formally decided later, so the marker must identify _this_ bounce operation,
not just the bucket). Immediately before each bounce write, re-fetch the ticket and scan for `[triage-bounce`,
since the gap between the table render and D's reply is enough time for another path to touch the ticket:

Capture the ticket's **pre-bounce state** and mint this operation's timestamped marker before the first write
attempt; the branches below compare against both, so "partial write" and "drift" stay distinguishable rather than
collapsing into a single catch-all, and a stale marker from an _earlier_ bounce can never be read as this one:

- **Exact marker for THIS operation present AND state already `Todo`** → fully done; skip with a note.
- **Exact marker for THIS operation present AND current state still equals the captured pre-bounce state** (comment
  landed, state write did not, on a prior attempt) → partial write; skip the comment op and complete only the
  missing state write.
- **Exact marker for THIS operation present AND current state is anything else** (e.g., already moved to
  `Done`/`Canceled` by another path) → drift; skip the write and report — never force a ticket another path has
  already advanced back to `Todo`.
- **No exact marker for THIS operation, AND current state still equals the captured pre-bounce state** (whether or
  not an _earlier_ `[triage-bounce: ...]` marker exists on the ticket) → proceed with a fresh write: post the "not
  a D-decision; execute or re-block" note under the new timestamped marker, then set state to `Todo`. An earlier
  bounce's marker is never read as evidence of a prior attempt for this operation — it is either drift from an
  unrelated past bounce (leave it, don't touch it) or simply irrelevant history.
- **No exact marker for THIS operation, but current state has moved off the captured pre-bounce state** → drift;
  skip and report. A missing marker is not permission to write: another path can advance a ticket without leaving
  one, and writing here sets `Todo` over a state change someone else made deliberately.

The state comparison is re-run immediately before the state write as well, not only before the comment — the two
ops are not atomic, and the window between them is exactly when another path lands.

Same write discipline as the A/D1/D2 path: verify each write, retry up to 3×, and on unrecoverable partial failure
report exactly what landed and halt that ticket rather than guessing.

### 11. Cascade lightly + collapse keystones

Comment on **direct** dependents to note the unblock. Give each cascade note a **deterministic marker** that names the
blocker, e.g. lead with `[unblock: <blocker-id>]` then "blocker resolved: `<decision>`". Before posting, scan the dependent
for that exact marker referencing this blocker and **skip if already present** — so reruns and later sessions never
duplicate the note (same idempotency contract as the decision comment, keyed on the blocker ID). When the ticket was a
**keystone**, also drop its now-resolved dependents out of the remaining walk (re-derive the A-queue) so you never ask
a question a prior answer already settled. Do NOT auto-transition downstream tickets — the agents own those;
auto-transitioning shared state is an irreversibility trap and is out of scope. These dependent comments are
**best-effort**: verify and retry once — but before that retry, re-scan for the exact marker and skip the retry if
it's already present, since the first attempt may have landed even though its verification response was lost (same
idempotency contract as step 10). On failure log the miss in the recap rather than halting — a failed
courtesy-comment must never block D's decisions.

### 12. Per-view special handling

- **Upcoming Deadlines** (risk pass): surface at-risk items (near/overdue dueDate, especially if also Blocked) and
  only ask D when an actual decision is needed (reprioritize, extend, drop). Don't force a question per ticket.
- **Ungroomed Backlog** (grooming pass): these need a `## Acceptance` section — that is **agent grooming, not a D
  decision**. Flag them and offer to route the batch to Clara; do not ask D to write acceptance criteria.

### 13. Capture standing policies (explicitly authorized only)

When a decision reads as a **standing rule** rather than a one-off (e.g. "job-application tickets close on Clara's
email delivery, not on D's submission"), surface that and ask D to **confirm it is a standing policy** before any
cross-ticket write. Only on D's explicit yes:

- Write it to persistent memory (one memory file; if one already covers it, update rather than duplicate).
- Note the owning agent + skill the rule should propagate to (a pointer/flag — do not silently rewrite another
  agent's skill here), and apply the rule to every matching ticket in the current queue.

This is a **deliberate, confirmed exception** to the "all writes stay on the decided ticket" guardrail — it is
allowed ONLY because D explicitly designated a standing policy. Without that explicit designation, record the ruling
as a normal per-ticket `[triage-decision]` and nothing more. If a policy write fails, report it and fall back to the
per-ticket record; never leave the rule half-propagated silently.

### 14. Deferred / skipped / mislabeled, recap, D-action checklist, suppression report

Every decision path has an explicit outcome — target state and whether a comment is written:

| Path                    | Target state                                           | Comment                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Normal decision         | per D's choice                                         | `[triage-decision]`                                                                    |
| Skip                    | unchanged                                              | none                                                                                   |
| Defer                   | unchanged (re-queued once, then left for next session) | brief "deferred by D" note                                                             |

End with a recap that carries three things:

1. **Counts** — decided / bulk-accepted / bounced / cancelled; comments posted; states changed; deferred/skipped.
2. **D-action checklist** — a first-class list of the concrete actions the decisions handed to D (shell commands,
   portal submits, GitHub-UI clicks), each hyperlinked, with anything already done marked ✅.
3. **Suppression report** — what was classified B/C/D and therefore NOT asked, so D can catch a misclassification.

## Decision comment template

Post every decision in this exact shape so the agents can parse D's rulings reliably:

```text
[triage-decision]
Decision: <what D chose>
Rationale: <one line — D's reasoning if given>
Decided-by: D via /process-linear triage
Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

## Guardrails (non-negotiable)

1. **Rubber-stamp risk** → the fleet creates the load this skill filters; classify independently (step 3), never
   trust a state blindly, and always emit the suppression report (step 14) so the filtering is auditable.
2. **Race with agents** → just-in-time re-fetch (step 6); skip-and-note on state drift.
3. **Deciding on unread/self-reported source** → verify against the source system (step 8) at money/secrets/
   irreversible/PR gates; flag + downgrade rec to tentative otherwise; offer to read first.
4. **Silent write failure** → verify-after-write, ≤3 retries, halt-and-report before advancing.
5. **Re-run duplication** → `[triage-decision]` marker checked in step 6; keystone collapse (step 11); never
   double-decide a ticket.
6. **Mislabeled state** → treat "this isn't really blocked/ready" as a valid answer; fix state, no fake decision.
7. **Execution boundary (D rule, 2026-07-24)** → triage RECORDS decisions; the owning agent (Dara/Clara/TARS)
   EXECUTES them. Do not merge PRs, send messages, or deploy on an approval — write the `[triage-decision]` and
   let the agent act on it. Act on D's behalf ONLY when the agent demonstrably cannot: D-only surfaces (billing
   dashboards, Google Search Console, D's accounts) or a live assist D explicitly requests in-session.

All writes stay on the decided ticket, and dependents get comments only. Nothing auto-transitions downstream.

## Hyperlink rule

Every ticket reference shown to D is a clickable markdown link built from the MCP-returned `url`, e.g.
`[<ID>](https://linear.app/bareclaude/issue/<ID>/<slug>)`. Never show a bare ID alone. The triage table's `Ticket`
and `Link` columns carry these links (ticket ID + the PR/artifact/issue D would open to judge), and the tier-2
detail blocks may add more.

**A grouped row links every ticket it covers, individually.** When one decision spans N tickets (step 9's
grouping rule), the `Ticket` cell carries N separate links — `[OPS-345](<url>) [OPS-346](<url>)`, never a
collapsed `[OPS-345/6](<url>)` or an abbreviated range. A collapsed form gives the second and later tickets no
destination, which is the bare-ID failure wearing a link's clothes: D can't open what the row is asking them to
decide on. `AskUserQuestion` chips may not render links, so when a drill-in dialog fires its links
live in the prose around it — that prose is load-bearing only for links and the post-decision record; all decision
context goes inside the dialog.

## Prerequisites

- Linear MCP connected. The connection lives in `~/.claude.json` (OAuth, runtime) — it is not versioned, so it does
  not travel with `/sync`.
- `gh` CLI authenticated with org access — required for the source-system verification in step 8 (PR state, org app
  installations, diffs).
- Read-only Linear and `gh` calls run prompt-free under the workspace's `bypassPermissions` mode; no allowlist needed.

## Notes

- Speed comes from parallel prefetch + a tight table, NOT from bundling unrelated decisions.
- The classification pass (step 3) is the whole game: it turns a 50-ticket wall into the ~10 that actually need D.
- Views mirror Clara's saved workspace views (`Needs Unblocking`, `Needs Your Sign-off`, `Upcoming Deadlines`,
  `Ungroomed Backlog`); keep names in sync if she renames them.
- Workspace convention: in `bareclaude`, `In Review` ≈ D's decision queue, not "ready to ship." But it is heavily
  overloaded (real decisions + completed briefs + code PRs) — the classification pass is what separates them.
