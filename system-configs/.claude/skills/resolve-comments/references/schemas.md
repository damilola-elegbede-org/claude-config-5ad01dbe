# Schemas and caller compatibility

## Ignored issues — `.tmp/coderabbit-ignored.json`

The filename is a cross-skill contract (`/pr` and `/ship-it` read it by this exact path) and keeps
its historical name. Its contents are source-agnostic: each record names its own `source`.

<!-- SCHEMA VERSION: "1.0" — Any breaking schema changes MUST increment schema_version. -->
<!-- Readers (e.g. pr/SKILL.md) validate this field on load and reject stale files. -->

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "branch": "feature/my-feature",
  "created_at": "2025-01-10T12:00:00Z",
  "ignored_issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "source": "coderabbit|codex|bot|human|code-reviewer",
      "location": "file.ts:45",
      "description": "Issue description",
      "severity": "LOW",
      "category": "nitpick|low-priority|user-skipped|human-thread-deferred",
      "reason": "Auto-generated reason from evaluation"
    }
  ]
}
```

`/ship-it` reads this file to acknowledge what was consciously not fixed.

## Context compatibility

This skill needs `AskUserQuestion` and so MUST NOT run with `context: fork` — a forked context can't
show the dialog to the user. A caller that runs it forked must pass `--auto` to bypass the prompts.

| Caller              | Flag required | Reason                          |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Direct user         | none          | Interactive triage available    |
| `/review`           | `--auto`      | Runs in `context: fork`         |
| `/feature-lifecycle`| `--auto`      | Autonomous orchestrator         |
